I recently graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering at the University of Central Florida and began my Masters in Computer Science at San Francisco State University. Please take a look at my [CV](http://mechanicalape.com/spalding_cv.pdf) and [send me an email](mailto:tommycs@mail.sfsu.edu) if you like what you see. My primary interests revolve around topics such as embedded systems, digital signal processing, microwave engineering and designing new musical interfaces.
