I recently graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering at the University of Central Florida and begin my Masters in Computer Science at SanFran State Uni this upcoming Fall. I would love to work for you, so please take a look at my [CV](http://mechanicalape.com/spalding_cv.pdf) and [send me an email](mailto:spalding@knights.ucf.edu) if you like what you see. My primary interests revolve around topics such as embedded systems, digital signal processing, microwave engineering and designing new musical interfaces. If these topics are paired with chemistry, environmental science, oceanography or other fantastic or inter-planetary science in general, you have my interest piqued. Also, if you're in the business of developing new audio synthesis techniques, you couldn't find a more enthusiastic recruit!
