I recently graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering at the University of Central Florida. I would love to work for you, so please take a look at my [CV](http://mechanicalape.com/spalding_cv.pdf) and [send me an email](mailto:spalding@knights.ucf.edu) if you like what you see. My primary interests revolve around topics such as embedded systems, digital signal processing, and designing new musical interfaces. Also, if you're in the business of creating new audio synthesis techniques, you couldn't find a more enthusiastic recruit!
