So, I'm apparently about as terrible as it gets with new years resolutions, but I *am* good about getting about. Since the last post I've been bopping all over from Orlando to Sunnyvale, to Orlando again, then St. Louis, then Orlando, and now I'm soon to go back to St. Louis then finally San Francisco, whew. Never said it was efficient traveling.. 

Instead of telling you about my projects, here is a picture I drew.
