Hi from [Fogcam](http://www.fogcam.org), the oldest webcam still running. That's me waving!
<img src="/images/webcam.jpg" />

So, got a few projects on their way that you'll be seeing in the upcoming year. A 3d printed planisphere, pd-patchable stompbox, a quick geotagging web and app template, and a touch-device d&d map supplement. I still have some projects on the backburner from [my last new years](http://antivapor.github.io/verbage/2012/12/31/happy-new-years), but I think [moving to San Fran](http://antivapor.github.io/verbage/2013/10/03/san-francisco) and starting grad school is good enough to allow an extension.  

Gonna see a show tonight .. just saw Voodoo Glow Skulls and Infected Mushroom and tonight will be either seeing NOFX or the Melvins.. tough decision for me.

The tides are supposed to be at their highest and lowest today ([King Tides](http://www.californiakingtides.org)), so on my way to [Sutro](http://antivapor.github.io/verbage/2013/10/03/san-francisco/#beach_sutro_baths_etc) and Lands End to explore normally unwalkable ground.

Peace & Love homies, TC
