{% include JB/setup %}

just bought a beautiful oldschool [drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._L._Drake_Company) [tr-22](http://www.wb4hfn.com/DRAKE/DrakeManuals/TR22/Manual_TR22.htm) ham radio made in 19__, (2 meter).

also got a retro [cassette player](kraco), so I can play some [Chrome BrulÃ©e](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVlm5aJRAbA).

star wars galaxy tunes, on the way.

aquatronics --> aquabats

really really excited about github's recent posts([1](https://github.com/blog/1528-there-s-a-map-for-that)/[2](https://github.com/blog/1541-geojson-rendering-improvements)). i have a few too many projects going on and was looking for something to sway me towards one or another. soo, this is earthdata.

also on the way are these patch-sets
[brewdata](https://github.com/antivapor/patches/brew)

[conky](https://github.com/antivapor/patches/conky) patches

messin' with some jass/galaxy script, and minecraft api. most productive when those startools boot me for playing sheeptag the way it is supposed to be. OG over here, I'm there to make some sick farm grids, not upgrade a single silly tower. This aint tower defense.. duh. angry coding, never thought that'd be a motivator.

got some new albums

the avengers, iggy pop, and devo

show and tell. listening is better.

update on the [cranes]() yo, aaand got some lovely moss, but have not spied the elusive moss piglet yet.

[[will sweeney](http://www.bigactive.com/illustration/will-sweeney/general-portfolio)] I love you. that was a bit [minty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3pIBIx_7oI&feature=player_detailpage#t=61s).

but back on topic; sorry, you lose the game.

back off topic, I've always disliked the naming of the semicolon; when in fact it has more surface area than the regular colon: it isn't very semi!
