Hi, time to yack about my life. I recently moved to [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco), and man has it been a journey!
###Orlando to Missouri
After saying all my goodbyes, had a lot of help from my best buds Mike and Mike, my good friends came out and saw me off. I left my cats with Hana, and my intrepid bud Logan and I set out from our place in a Uhaul, towing my truck. I'd packed all my earthly belongings in that metal box and we took a straight trip to [Chesterfield, MO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesterfield,_Missouri) non-stop.

It definitely felt like we were in [On the Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Road).

###Missouri
We dumped all my things in storage, and spent time cleaning up at my mom's place, before heading out again in my truck.

###Missouri Outbound
Kansas was boring.

###Colorado
Colorado was great to drive through. Got some good mountain practice driving manual that just isn't possible in Florida.
