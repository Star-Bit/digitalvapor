Hi, time to yack about my life. I recently moved to [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco), and man has it been a journey!

###Orlando to Missouri
After saying all my goodbyes, had a lot of help from my best buds Mike and Mike, my good friends came out and saw me off, I left my cats with Hana, and my intrepid bud Logan and I set out from our place in a Uhaul, towing my truck. I'd packed all my earthly belongings in that metal box and we took a straight trip to Missouri non-stop.

It definitely felt like we were in [On the Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Road).

###Missouri
We dumped all my things in storage, and spent time cleaning up at my mom's place, before heading out again in my truck.

###Missouri Outbound
Kansas was boring.

###Colorado
Colorado was great to drive through. Got some good mountain practice driving manual that just isn't possible in Florida.

###Moab and Zion Utah, and Nevada
The first place we stopped to go camping had the most stunning stars. We camped near Arches on Bureau of Land Management land. I'll never forget how many and distinct they were, and especially the two gigantic swaths of galactic color in the sky.

This was a pretty common sight for a long while until we got to nowheres land.

###Where were we?

I felt as if we were going to bump into [these guys](https://youtube.com/watch?v=YvT5KCGZYck).

###California!
We weren't greeted by any 'Welcome to California' signs, but the beautiful Sierras sure did fine. It was nice to get out of the barren lands. 

###Mono lake

###Yosemite

An upcoming post will have our geotagged photos!

We spent two days in Yosemite at the [Yosemite Creek Campground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_Creek_Campground), and did some serious hiking.

###San Francisco!
First time crossing the Bay Bridge.

###Stoop Cat
My kitty Sif and I were vagrants! I wish I had a pic of me walking her on Haight.

###Beach, Sutro Baths, Etc
Logan, Hana, and I did some serious exploring of the city the first week here until my friends had to head back home for school.

There's really been too much adventure since; whether making new friends, camping at [Mt. Tamalpais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tamalpais), starting school, going to the [Zoo](http://www.sfzoo.org), city gardening, pubcrawling, mopeds, shows, [Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net), art, hobos, cats, fog, you name it, I love this crazy city.
