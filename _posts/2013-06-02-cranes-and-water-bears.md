I found a [dead sandhill crane](http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/284624). It was pretty big. Damn Tom, that's some real naturalist stuff. There are a few that hang out on my work's campus and I assume this is one of them. They're [not doing too well in Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhill_Crane#Status_and_conservation), but I'm rooting for them! Will be bringing my camera today when I bike the local trail. I'll also be collecting moss to start another terrarium and while I'm at it, hopefully find some [water bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade). If I do find any, I'll be sure to add the [observation](http://www.inaturalist.org/observations?taxon_id=124337)! 

Check out my [bichir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypterus_senegalus) snagging a minnow! He's got wittle primitive lungs and is super brutal, and I love him for it.

edit: the local crane family is doing a-okay.
